# Air Quality Prediction End-to-End Project

## Overview

This is an end-to-end project demonstrating knowledge in predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on user input using machine learning. The project is implemented in Python and HTML, with Flask used to convert it into a web application.

## Components

### 1. Data Ingestion
- [Provide a brief description of the data ingestion component and its role.]

### 2. Data Transformation
- [Briefly explain the purpose and functionality of the data transformation component.]

### 3. Model Trainer
- [Describe the model trainer component, including the machine learning model used and its purpose.]

## Pipeline

### Predict Pipeline
- [Explain the predict pipeline, detailing how the components work together to predict the Air Quality Index.]

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

The project employs the following machine learning algorithms for predicting the Air Quality Index:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- AdaBoost

## Technologies Used
- Python
- HTML
- Flask

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
